## ✨ Project Description

<!--proyect_content_description-->
This project was created purely for fun, with the goal of replicating the visual style and behavior of the infamous “FNaF World Ransomware” using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. While it contains no malicious functionality, the project recreates the interface, animations, and transitions that define the original aesthetic—including the title screen, loading sequence, and game map.

The intention was to explore retro graphic design, real-time event handling, and scene navigation logic within a safe and controlled environment.

## 🎯 Project Objective

<!--proyect_content_objective-->
The main goal was to **recreate the visual experience and navigation flow** of an environment inspired by the FNaF World Ransomware, without replicating its original behavior. It served as a creative exercise to practice using Pygame, managing sprites, animations, sounds, and transitions between screens.

This project also provided a foundation for understanding how 2D games are structured, how rendering cycles work, and how to simulate interactive experiences using custom graphic assets.

## 🧩 General Functionality

<!--proyect_content_functionality-->
The application consists of three main scenes:

1. **Title screen:** Intro animation with visual effects and background music, mimicking the original style.
2. **Loading screen:** Visual transition with a simulated progress bar and sound effects.
3. **Game map:** Overview of the environment with animated sprites, key detection, and basic navigation.

Each scene is controlled by a main loop that handles events, rendering, and state updates.

## 🖥️ Design and User Experience

<!--proyect_content_designUX-->
The design is inspired by the retro and glitchy style of the original ransomware, featuring intense colors, pixelated fonts, and abrupt transitions. Custom sprites and visual effects were used to reinforce the project’s atmosphere.

The user experience is intended to be visually striking, with simple but immersive navigation. The map includes interactive elements and animations that simulate movement and depth.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

<!--proyect_content_architecture-->
The project is structured into independent modules that manage each scene:

- **Main engine:** Game loop with event control, FPS management, and rendering.
- **Scene management:** Transitions between title, loading, and map views.
- **Sprites and animation:** Use of `.png` images and animation cycles with timers.
- **Sound:** Playback of `.wav` effects and background music.
- **Input control:** Key detection for navigation and simulated interaction.

All code is written in Python, using Pygame as the foundation for graphics, sound, and event handling.
